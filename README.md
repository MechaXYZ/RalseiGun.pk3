# Oh my God, Ralsei's got a gun!

This companion mod adds Ralsei from Deltarune, but with a gun!

Features:
* Ralsei heals you when you're under 30 HP
* Ralsei still uses his scarf to fight in close range
* Press [Use] on Ralsei to make him sit or stand up (you might need to get really close for it to work)
* fluffiness
